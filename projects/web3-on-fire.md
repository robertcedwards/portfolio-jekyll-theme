Web3 on Fire is a podcast series I host with Ambire Wallet to bring Web3 Founders on the show and hear the latest from the builders and makers in the space. As the host and producer, I've led the project from its inception, successfully blending insightful discussions, expert interviews, and up-to-date trends within the Web3 community.

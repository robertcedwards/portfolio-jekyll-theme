title: 'Dustins Words'

"Dustin's Words" is an assistive communication device designed to help non-verbal individuals, particularly those with on the spectrum, express their needs and thoughts. Developed initially for personal use in 2014 by our friend Matt Reamer for his brother, Dustin. It allows users to send simple text messages over Wi-Fi at the push of a button, aiding communication with caregivers. Originating as a prototype for one, the project now aims to evolve into a consumer-level product accessible to many. It includes a physical device and an easy-to-use web tool for customization by caregivers. The project highlights open-source code and shared 3D sketches, fostering community involvement and customization. It was crowdfunded on Indiegogo and an initial set was created and given to the community.
